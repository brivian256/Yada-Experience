## Upcoming Events

At YADA-EXPERIENCE, we host a variety of events throughout the year designed to inspire, educate, and connect young individuals on their journey of purpose discovery. Our events range from immersive workshops and multi-day retreats to informational sessions and community celebrations. Each event is thoughtfully crafted to create meaningful experiences that advance our mission of youth empowerment and purpose development.

We invite you to join us at our upcoming events to experience firsthand the transformative power of purpose-focused community. Whether you're a young person seeking direction, a parent or educator supporting youth development, or a community member interested in our work, there's an event that's right for you.

### Featured Events

#### Purpose Discovery Workshop
**Date:** June 15, 2025  
**Time:** 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM  
**Location:** YADA Center, Kampala  

This full-day immersive experience guides participants through a series of reflective activities and interactive exercises designed to uncover core values, natural strengths, and authentic interests. Facilitated by our experienced purpose coaches, the workshop creates a supportive environment for self-exploration and insight generation.

Participants will engage in personal reflection, small group discussions, creative expression, and action planning. By day's end, each person will have drafted a personal purpose statement and identified next steps for living more purposefully. The workshop includes all materials, lunch, and refreshments, plus follow-up resources to continue the journey after the event.

This workshop is ideal for young adults (ages 16-25) seeking greater clarity about their direction in life, whether facing educational decisions, career transitions, or simply wanting to live with more intention and meaning.

**Time:** 10:00 AM - 4:00 PM  
**Location:** Kampala International Convention Center  

This dynamic event connects young people with diverse career possibilities and the professionals who bring them to life.

The expo features representatives from various sectors including business, technology, healthcare, education, arts, social impact, government, and entrepreneurship. Each booth offers interactive elements designed to give attendees a taste of what working in that field actually involves.

This event welcomes young people at all stages of their career journey, from high school students beginning to explore options to young professionals considering transitions or advancement.
