# Get Involved / Join Our Team

## Make an Impact with YADA-EXPERIENCE

Becoming part of YADA-EXPERIENCE means joining a community dedicated to transforming young lives through purpose discovery and development. We believe that everyone has something valuable to contribute to this mission, whether through volunteering time, sharing expertise, offering financial support, or joining our professional team. Your involvement, whatever form it takes, directly impacts our ability to reach more young people and deepen the quality of our programs.

The young individuals we serve benefit tremendously from connecting with diverse role models who demonstrate different paths to purpose-driven living. By getting involved, you not only contribute to our organizational capacity but also become part of the expanded network of caring adults who inspire and guide the next generation. Many of our most committed team members began their journey with us through volunteer roles or one-time contributions before finding deeper ways to engage with our mission.

## Volunteer Opportunities

Volunteering with YADA-EXPERIENCE offers flexible ways to contribute based on your availability, interests, and skills. Our volunteers consistently report that they receive as much as they give through their service, gaining new perspectives, developing skills, and experiencing the profound satisfaction of supporting young people's growth.

### Program Volunteers

Work directly with young participants in our various programs, supporting activities and building encouraging relationships. Program volunteers might assist workshop facilitators, lead small group discussions, share personal stories during panels, or help with logistics during events. This role requires a commitment to scheduled program sessions and completion of our volunteer training program, which covers youth development principles, appropriate boundaries, and effective engagement strategies.

The ideal program volunteer brings enthusiasm, empathy, and a genuine interest in young people's journeys. While professional experience in education or youth work is valuable, we equally value life experience and the ability to connect authentically with young people. Many of our most effective program volunteers simply bring their authentic selves and willingness to listen and encourage.

### Skills-Based Volunteers

Contribute specialized skills to enhance our organizational capacity and program quality. We welcome professionals from various fields who can offer expertise in areas such as:

- Graphic design and visual communication
- Web development and digital content creation
- Photography and videography
- Marketing and social media management
- Event planning and coordination
- Curriculum development
- Research and evaluation
- Administrative support and database management

Skills-based volunteering can be structured as one-time projects, regular ongoing support, or advisory roles. We work with each volunteer to define clear deliverables and timelines that respect their availability while meeting organizational needs.

### Community Ambassadors

Help expand our reach and impact by representing YADA-EXPERIENCE in your networks and communities. Ambassadors raise awareness about our mission, connect us with potential partners and participants, and help identify resources to support our work. This role is ideal for individuals with strong community connections who are passionate about advocating for youth development and purpose education.

Ambassadors receive orientation to our messaging and programs, regular updates to share, and support from our community engagement coordinator. The time commitment is flexible, with ambassadors determining their own outreach activities based on their networks and comfort level.

## Mentorship Opportunities

Becoming a mentor represents one of the most direct and profound ways to impact a young person's journey. Our mentors commit to regular one-on-one meetings with their mentees, providing guidance, encouragement, and perspective as young people navigate their purpose discovery process.

### Mentor Requirements

- Minimum one-year commitment to the mentoring relationship
- Availability for bi-weekly meetings (in-person or virtual)
- Participation in initial mentor training (12 hours) and ongoing support sessions
- Professional or life experience relevant to mentees' interests and questions
- Successful completion of background check and reference verification
- Genuine interest in supporting young people's growth without imposing personal agendas

We carefully match mentors and mentees based on shared interests, compatible communication styles, and mentee preferences. Our mentorship coordinator provides ongoing support to both parties, ensuring the relationship remains productive and appropriate. Many of our mentoring relationships extend beyond the initial commitment period, evolving into lasting connections that continue to benefit both mentor and mentee.
